# skew

This repository downloads six months of NVDA price data from Yahoo
Finance, computes the skewness of daily log returns, and produces plots
showing daily trading volume and 30â€‘day rolling skewness.

Run `python skew_nvda.py` to regenerate the statistics. The script saves
plots to `docs/nvda_volume.png` and `docs/nvda_skew.png`, which are
ignored in version control.
