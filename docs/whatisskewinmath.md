# What is skew in math?

Skewness is a measure of how asymmetric a probability distribution is around its mean. 
A distribution with a long right tail has positive skewness, while one with a long left tail has negative skewness.

For a sample of data points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ with mean $\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$, the sample skewness $g_1$ is computed as:

$$
 g_1 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s} \right)^3.
$$

Skewness helps quantify whether returns are distributed symmetrically or whether extreme values occur more on one side of the mean than the other.
